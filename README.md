# Hi-Lo-Game
### Description
This repository contains an HTML and JavaScript implementation of a Hi-Lo game. The game prompts the player for their name and the maximum guess number, generates a random number within the specified range, and allows the player to guess until they find the correct number. The application provides real-time feedback on the guessing range and validates user inputs to ensure a smooth gaming experience.

### Tools Used
- HTML
- JavaScript

### Features
- User-friendly interface with real-time feedback
- Validation of user inputs to ensure data integrity
- Dynamic UI updates based on user actions
- Ability to play multiple rounds with different maximum guess numbers
- Responsive design compatible with Microsoft Edge and Chrome browsers

### Install and Run Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `a01.html` file in your preferred web browser (Microsoft Edge or Chrome).

### Interesting Parts during the Build Process
- Implementing dynamic UI updates based on user inputs while maintaining simplicity and clarity.
- Creating a smooth user experience by providing real-time feedback on allowable guessing range and input validation.

### Difficulties we had and how we overcame them
- Ensuring proper input validation without cluttering the user interface. I overcame this challenge by implementing clear error messages and utilizing JavaScript's built-in validation functions.
- Managing the transition between different stages of the game, such as prompting for player name, setting maximum guess number, and the main guessing phase. I addressed this by carefully structuring the JavaScript code and utilizing event listeners to control the flow of the game.

### Future Updates and Fixes
- Enhancing the visual appeal of the user interface with CSS styling.
- Adding sound effects to enhance the gaming experience.
- Implementing a leaderboard to track high scores.
- Optimizing the code for better performance and compatibility with additional web browsers.
